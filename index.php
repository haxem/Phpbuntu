// Hello. Here we start the

// If index.php is the first 
// place to look for for web-server
// We are in MBR, Not BIOS

// No need to MBR (this is web based)
    // No need to check all partitions
    // No need to check active partitions
// AS MBR do.

# So, Just call grub...
/**
*@todo: call grub here.
